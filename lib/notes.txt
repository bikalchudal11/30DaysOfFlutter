2) primarySwatch gives the theme color to our app.
3) / in routes is the default/homepage.
4) class is a blueprint of their objects.
5) new keyword is used to make an object of a class but the compiler of flutter is smart enough to understand it without using the new keyword.

7) Every widgets has its own key.

Day 4.
1) Whenever you add some external plugins in your project it is necessary to restart or rerun your app but if you use package then it is not necessary to restart the app.
2) SizedBox is more preferable for using space between two widgets.
3) Textfield are of 2 types: 1) Normal Textfield  2) TextFormField

Day 5.
1) ScrollView is used in case the size of the screen is small and so the widgets can be scrollable also fix the issue of bottom over flow.
2) Static can be accessed without creating an object and it is not recommended to use every time unless and until it is necessary.
3) We use navigator class while going to another page on performing some action.
4) push is used to put data over something and pop means to retrieve data from something called stack.

Day 6.

7) Gesture Detector have no ripple effect like InkWell.
8) Animated container is like normal container but it has animation in it.
9) Whenever we use await then the above function must be async.

Day 7. Was our Q and A.

Day 8.
1) Inkwell ripple effect is possible if its parents is material, otherwise the ripple effect is only seen in background and it is recommended to apply on normal container.
2) Ink widget is similar as container, it gives more decoration features and it is used with InkWell.
3) So for ripple effect you make sure that the material child must not have decoration features.
4) TextFormField has validation features and onChanged function.
5) Using Form widget as parent for TextFormField, they can be used for grouping.
6) Returning null means no error, compiled successfully.

Day 9.
1) We discuss about the dart dev tools(CTRL + ALT + D).
2) Now we develop our homepage.
3) In drawer we normally see a list of widget so for that we use listView widget.
4) Since we are using image that is coming from the network we use Image.Network('url').
5) ListTile is a widget used to create list items that contains leading, trailing, title etc.
6) ListTile also has onTap callback function.

Day 10.
1) There is AppBarTheme property in main.dart to make your appBar of your choice.
2) All the appBar properties is changed by doing changes in AppBarTheme.

Day 11.
1) currentAccountPicture is like SizedBox, its height and width is fixed so that is why we cannot set the height and width of currentAccountPicture technically. 
2) Constraints sets the minHeight, maxHeight, minWidth and maxWidth for a widget that must be followed.
3) Widgets are immutable, changes in widgets are illusion or say blueprint technically.
4) There are basically 3 components while doing changes in widgets: 1) Widget Tree  2) Element Tree  3) Render Tree.
5) In Widget tree we write the changes, Render tree helps us in painting and Element tree helps in communicating between Widget tree and Render tree also update the changes by calling build method again.
6) Context is basically Element tree and it also locates the location of widget.

Day 12.
1) String interpolation is used to put variable value inside widgets.
2) Card widget helps us to show the widget like card and it improves the design of the app
